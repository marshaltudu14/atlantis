## 4. Design & Technology

### 4.1. Responsiveness and Performance

*   **Mobile-First Approach:** The website must be designed with a mobile-first approach, ensuring a seamless and intuitive experience on smartphones and tablets. The layout, navigation, and all interactive elements must be optimized for smaller screens.
*   **Cross-Device Compatibility:** The landing page must be fully responsive and render perfectly across all major browsers and devices, from mobile phones to high-resolution desktop monitors.
*   **Performance Optimization:**
    *   **Page Speed:** The site must be optimized for fast loading times to prevent user drop-off and improve search engine ranking.
    *   **Asset Optimization:** All assets, especially images and videos, must be compressed and optimized for the web without sacrificing quality. If a video is used in the hero section, it should be lazy-loaded and served in a modern, efficient format (e.g., WebM).
    *   **Code Minification:** Code will be minified to reduce file sizes and improve load times.


*   **Design:**
    *   **Aesthetic:** Futuristic yet modern, with a strong emphasis on a premium and royal feel. The design will be clean, elegant, and visually stunning.
    *   **Theme:** The application will use a **light theme exclusively** to maintain a clean, airy, and premium aesthetic.
    *   **Visuals:** High-impact, professional photography and videography will be at the core of the design. All images and videos must be of the highest quality.
    *   **Typography:** Elegant and modern fonts that are easy to read and convey sophistication.
    *   **Animations:** Subtle and fluid animations to enhance the user experience.

*   **Technology Stack:**
    *   **Frontend Framework:** Next.js (React)
    *   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
    *   **UI Components:** `shadcn/ui` for accessible and customizable components.
    *   **Data:** Initially hardcoded in a structured format (e.g., JSON files) for easy transition to a database or CMS later.
