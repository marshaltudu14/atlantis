# Project Brief: Atlantis Real Estate Landing Page

## 1. Project Overview

**Project Name:** Atlantis Real Estate

**Objective:** To create a modern, professional, and responsive landing page for "Atlantis," a real estate business. The primary goals of this landing page are to capture leads, showcase featured properties, and build brand awareness. The initial version will be a single-page application with hardcoded data, but designed with scalability in mind for future expansion.

## 2. Target Audience

The primary target audience includes potential homebuyers, sellers, and renters in Rourkela, Odisha. The design and content should be appealing to a broad demographic, from young professionals to families.
